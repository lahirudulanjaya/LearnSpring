### Spring Profile
Spring Profile is a feature in the Spring Framework that provides a way to manage different configurations for different environments in which an application runs. A profile is a set of configuration settings that are specific to a particular environment, such as development, test, production, etc. Profiles can be activated using a variety of methods, such as command-line arguments, system properties, or JNDI variables, and they allow developers to customize the behavior of an application without changing its code. This helps to reduce the amount of code duplication, promote consistency, and simplify maintenance, by separating environment-specific configuration into separate profile-specific configuration files
